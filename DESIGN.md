# Design
The design goals of our new new social engine will be:

- Accessible
- Scalable
- Extensible
- Multi-lingual
- Modular
- Brandable

To be continued...

## Software components
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## UI/UX
We would like to provide an extendable minimalistic theme that can be branded easily. The theme will be based on a design system with its own HTML/CSS library that can be reused as well.
